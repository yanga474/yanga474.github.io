    <h1>Have you ever been in a car accident?</h1>
     
    <p>Yes. I got into a car accident by myself. What happened was, I was coming home from work and it was past midnight. So luckily, there were barely any cars out on the street. However, before I went into the car to start driving back home, there was a bug on the top window part. I ignored it because I didn't think otherwise. As I was driving back home, at a curving area, the bug flew right onto my face. And well, you can pretty much guess what happened after thatâ€¦ My car had to be towed and was not able to be repaired. </p>
