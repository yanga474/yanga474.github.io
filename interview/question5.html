    <p>If i were to die tonight, i would not think that I have lived my life to the fullest. It's sad to think like that, but I don't think I did. I basically lived a very ordinary and mundane life. Go to school and get a good future kind of life. I know it may sound like it is what everyone wnats to do, and it pretty much is. However I want to travel to many places as much as possible and actually be able to enjoy life and eat good food. </p>
