       	The keynote was about accessibilities and user experience for all audiences. There were a couple of things that the keynote speaker Sina Bahram mentioned that was quite interesting and said in a way I've never thought of before, for one the rectangular light switches. It's in our subconscious that the button is easily accessible but I never thought about it in a disabled user's point of view. Because of the rectangular shape of the switch, it allows users to use minimal psychical force and it also does not have to enforce in the traditional way of using your hands. I thought that was a really neat way of putting a simple everyday object and showing that it has evolved into suiting the needs of all audiences. I was really surprised that Banhram brought up the topic of 3D printing. It was very refreshing to see that 3D printing has also affected people with disabilities in a positive way. The fact that the double helix can be printed in great detail allows blind people to understand the molecule without visuals is pretty astounding. Creating designs that are targeted to all audiences has to be the new goal for designers. Inclusivity in user experience is extremely important in our society, not only that designs that are specifically targeted to disabled user also have to be universally accessible. These design have to work both ways in order to achieve the best results.
