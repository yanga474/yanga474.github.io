       	This piece of text is about Bill Atkinson. It starts off giving a brief synopsis of how Atkinson ended up with a career in neurochemistry and also producing beautiful prints of his photography. During his studies, he took classes in programming and computer science. Atkinson's teacher Jef Raskin at the time sound his raw talent and decided to send him to Apple to help with a design application software they were working on. The first big project Atkinson did for Apple was porting over the Pascal system from UC Diego to the Apple II.  Later he was asked to lead the design of graphics and user interface for Lisa. Throughout this process he had a lot of obstacles such as defending the importance of user interface against the pressure of cost and technological limitations. During this process, Bill and Larry formed a close working relationship with each other.  Bill would make prototypes of the user interface concepts during the night, while Larry will run tests during the day. Bill and Larry designed the pull-down menu that is across the screen like our computers today. Atkinson recorded his whole process as well as the prototypes by taking Polaroid photographs and then writing notes on them. In the next part of the text titled "Apple Mac", the author wrote that Bill Atkinson became known as â€œMr. User Interface at Apple. He designed the graphics for Lisa and wrote the window, event manager and menu manger. These later were cooperated in the Macintosh. Steve Job managed to make the Mac a lot more user friendly and design was unique that was very appealing.

Verplank says that "the interaction designer has three questions to answer; they are all "How do you...?" questions." 1. "How do you do?"" He answers with a simple question "How do you affect the world?" 2. How do you feel? He says that designers design the way that the machine or the system gives feedback to the user. A lot of our emotions come from sensory qualities of those media that we present things with. 3. How do you know? A map gives the knowledge of what may be needed when designing complex systems. It's the designer's responsibility to help people understand by showing them a map or a path. Verplank says that there is a four-step interaction design process. First, because of an error or inspiration, the designer will be able to decide what's the goal of the design should be. Second, the designer must find metaphors that connect with the motivation with the end goal and create scenarios to aid them to create some meaning to the design. Third, the designer must work out step-by-step of the task and find a conceptual model that ties them together. Fourth, the display and control is picked to fit the design and how it will be arranged. </p>
