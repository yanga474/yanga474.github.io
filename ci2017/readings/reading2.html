       	Trough a design-theory view, Meredith Davis states that interaction is not solely just used on computers but also through works by designers. Davis gave an example by Massimo Vignelli's work on the National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds that displays "particularly thoughtful design for interaction." In addition, Richard Buchanan shares the same views a Meredith Davis. "Interaction is a way of framing the relationship between people and objects design for them."

        Another view on interaction is the HCI view, where it states that an individual has one goal and must be achieved in a specific environment and the effects of his or her actions on the environment will be measured. Then it will be finally compared with the goal. The results will prompt the next step, beginning this cycle again. 



		<p align="center" style="font-family:cambria">I think both ways is a great look at how design affected interaction. Designers must design in ways where they know how it will affect the environment and the people interacting with it. This is the base of good design. In the part of the reading that discusses the design-theory, it states, "all man-made objects offer the possibility for interaction and all design activities can be view as design for interaction." I completely agree with this statement. I think human beings are so wired to think that any tactile object or user interface program will respond in some form or shape and we already have some indication of what it should be doing.  </p>
