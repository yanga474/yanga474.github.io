    	Monday Morning.

		Natalia groans as she turns off her 7 am alarm and slowly gets out of bed to do the usual routine to get ready for class. She quickly gets dressed and heads out to get her morning coffee at her favorite coffee shop. She walks out of house and walks towards the little shop on the corner. Natalia orders her usual black coffee and bagel. Everything was going rather normal and like her typical morning until some guy bumps into her causing her to drop the coffee.

		What should Natalia do?  </p>
