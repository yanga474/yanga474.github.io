## terminal and git review:
- `pwd`: show current location
- `cd`: change directory -- use this to navigate your computer
  - `cd` by itself navigates to the home folder; these all mean the same:
    - `cd`
    - `cd ~`
    - `cd /Users/sam`
- `mkdir`: make new directory (folder)
- `ls`: list what's in this directory
  - also try `ls -al` and `tree`
- `open`: open a file or folder
  - note that `open .` will open finder wherever you are in the terminal
- `cp`: copy
- `mv`: move
- `rm`: remove (be careful)

- `git add .`: add everything below the current level
- `git commit -m "your commit message"`: commit changes
- `git push`: push local changes to the internet
- `git pull`: pull remote changes to your computer
- `git clone ...`: copy an entire repository onto your computer wherever the terminal currently is
